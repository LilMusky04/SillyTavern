This, when combined with their psychological instability, those deemed Abomination are feared and considered very dangerous by the Sisterhood. Standing orders exist for Bene Gesserit that anyone believed to be Abomination are to be immediately killed.\n\nAbomination and the Great Temptation:\nWhile Abomination is primarily used to describe being overwhelmed by the ego-memory of an ancestor, Alia and Lady Jessica also use the term to describe those who have succumbed to the Great Temptation: altering their internal chemistry to arrest the aging process and live indefinitely. When she first sees the fact that Alia has not aged at all since she last saw her, she realizes that the apparent rumors amongst the Bene Gesserit that her daughter is engaged in these forbidden practices are true.",

It was based on Holtzman's original shield design, but was then heavily modified by herself. The first invention which employed this principle are the glowglobes.\nSuspensors are used in chairs, tables, and structures that are too massive to be physically sound, among many other obvious uses.\nThe grotesquely obese Baron Vladimir Harkonnen utilised suspensor belts and harnesses to buoy his flesh and allow him to walk.

However, at night, when the air cools, some moisture will develop. This moisture will then be carried by winds across the surface of the planet. Essentially a large air intake, the windtraps capture this air so that the moisture can be extracted from it by the Fremen, after it condenses.\nImperial Planetologist Pardot Kynes incorporated the windtraps into his terraforming program. However, he had surmised that the water reclaimed from this system would not be enough, and that a self-sustaining precipitation system would need to exist. As a result, he began a plantation drive across the planet. ",

Their name comes from the fact that when they change shape their faces appear to 'dance' as the flesh moves.\n\nLimitations: Pheromones can be detected by a Bene Gesserit adept. A Bene Gesserit Sister or Reverend Mother can detect them by a subtle but distinct odor emitted by their pheromones.The The Face Dancer can become delusional and start to believe that they are in fact the person they are mimicking.

Two decades later, Mohiam had become the Truthsayer to Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV and tested the young Paul Atreides before his departure for Arrakis with the gom jabbar. The test was to discover whether Paul was \"truly human\" by trial of pain, using a small box that Paul placed his hand inside. The pain inflicted on Paul was caused by nerve induction and clearly drained an incredible amount of energy from the Reverend Mother, since no male or female child had ever withstood that much physical pain before.",

This level of extreme and extended exposure causes their bodies to atrophy and mutate over time, their heads and extremities elongating. The first external sign of melange-induced metabolic change is visible in the eyes, as the drug tints the sclera and iris to a dark shade of blue. The shade of blue is known to be called \"blue-in-blue\" or \"the Eyes of Ibad,\" \"a total blue so dark as to be almost black.\" This is a common side effect in all spice addicts. ",

The tiny floating tadpole-like machine is remotely controlled by an operator situated close by.\n\nStats\nVelocity: up to 25 meters per second\nLength: 1 centimeter\nMass: Negligible\nRange: up to 50 meters\nAmmunition: Single needle\n\nOperation and Technology: The device floats through the air, using a tiny Holtzman Field Generator to maneuver. The tip holds a camera that transmits a video signal back to the operator. Vision is distorted by the compressed suspensor field. Once detected, the target is almost guaranteed to be killed.\nThe killing device itself is a tiny needle, tipped with a quick-acting, lethal poison. The needle is retracted until a target is acquired, at which point it appears, shortly before the device shoots into the victim.\n\nCounteraction: Destroying a Hunter-seeker is rather simple. Like any machine, it can be destroyed by being smashed or submerged in water. Paul Atreides employed both means to destroy a Hunter-seeker that had been launched to kill him on Arrakis, shortly before the invasion of House Harkonnen. ",

Sapho is extracted from the root of the Ecaz tree and its use doubles or even triples the Mentat's immense processing power. Repeated use turns the user's lips a shade of red.\n    The Tleilaxu have found a way to create Twisted Mentats, that bypass the ethical framework instilled in all traditionally trained Mentats.\n\nThe Mentat Mantra:\n\"It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, the stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.\"",

Otheym was also the one tasked with taking the Waters of Life to a very large pre-spice mass, which if intiated, would have created a deadly chain reaction ultimately destroying all vectors of the sandworm.\nOtheym serves as a senior commander in the spread of Muad'dib's Jihad across the Known Universe. He returns to Dune after contracting the spitting disease on Tarahell. A true Fremen and friend to Muad'dib until the end, Otheym provided details on those plotting against the Atreides Emperor.

Often wild dancing occurs, as well as sexual activity.\nOne of these occurred involving the Lady Jessica when she became the new Reverend Mother for the Fremen after she and Paul-Muad'Dib joined the group. Mother Ramallo who had served before Lady Jessica was too old in physical form to journey with the Fremen as they retreated to a new sietch and so passed on the water of life, Kan, on to Jessica who was with child at the time. Jessica then passes the converted drug on to Paul and the rest of the tribe which prompts a much heightened prescience in Paul. ",
